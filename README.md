# kummer2
The final resting place of the \\kummer2 network.

This is the entirety of me and my classmates old computer science server from pre-covid before our teacher retired and the computer lab was destroyed. 
This file system holds a great deal of importance as it is where we got all of or project data. I think someone even made a chat room for the server so thats somewhere in here.
Most of the cool stuff is under 'Student Work/Writable Folder'
Happy travels!
