// RandGen objects provide a source of computer-generated random numbers
// (sometimes known as pseudo-random numbers).  
//
// By default, a RandGen object will produce a different series of
// numbers (through repeated calls to the RandInt and RandDouble
// methods) every time the program is run.  When testing, though, it is
// often useful to have a program generate the same sequence of numbers
// each time it is run; this can be achieved by specifying a "seed" when
// the first RandGen object in the program is created.
//
// To construct random integers in a given range, client programs
// should use RandInt.  To construct random doubles, client programs
// should use RandReal.  The ranges for the return values for these
// functions are indicated with mathematical notation:
//    [0..max)     means a number between 0 and max,
//                 not including max but including 0;
//    [0..max]     means a number between 0 and max, including
//                 both 0 and max.
//
// For example,
//    RandGen r;
//    r.RandInt(5)         an int between 0 and 5, not including 5
//    r.RandInt(0, 5)      an int between 0 and 5, might include 0 or 5
//    r.RandReal()         a double between 0 and 1, not including 1
//    r.RandReal(4, 6)     a double between 4 and 6, might include 4 or 6
//
// Technical Note:
//   The "seed" used by all random number generation in a program is set
//   the first time a random number generator object is constructed by
//   the program.  All other random number generator objects created
//   later in the program will use the same seed.

      //                 both 0 and max.
