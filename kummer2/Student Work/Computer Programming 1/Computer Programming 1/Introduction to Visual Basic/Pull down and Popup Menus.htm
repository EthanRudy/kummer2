<H2><I>Pull Down Menus</I></H2>
<P><B>Pull down menus are used extensively in Windows applications. They have a 
number of advantages:</B></P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P>The menu names are visible textual items on the menu bar, so the user can 
  see the main functions of the software at all times.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Menu titles, or menu items (such as Open Project on the File menu) should 
  be unambiguous if they are well chosen, whereas, it can be difficult to design 
  satisfactory icons for abstract functions <IMG 
  src="Pull down and Popup Menus_files/open.gif"> is the standard icon for 
  open.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The menu bar takes up very little space on the screen.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The menu options are generally available by means of access keys (holding 
  down the Ctrl key then typing underlined letters of the menu title and menu 
  item required, so Ctrl+O for ‘Open Project’ on the ‘File’ menu).</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Functions are grouped together to form a set of menu items that are 
  related, this helps users to know where to look for facilities.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>An effort has been made to standardise the naming and ordering of menu 
  items across applications (especially Microsoft), so that packages are easier 
  to learn and use.</P></LI></UL>
<P>When building new applications in VB, existing menu conventions should be 
used unless there is a very good reason to depart from them.</P>
<P>Meus are created using the Menu Design Window found under the Window menu. 
This window can also be invoked by clicking on the <IMG 
src="Pull down and Popup Menus_files/pulldown.gif"> icon on the toolbar.</P>
<P>
<DIV align=center><IMG border=0 
src="Pull down and Popup Menus_files/menu_1.gif"></DIV>
<P></P>
<P>The top half of the Menu Design Window contains the menu control properties. 
The lower half is the menu control list box, where the menu/submenu structures 
for the current form are built up. The above Menu Design Window produces the 
menu shown below.</P>
<P>
<DIV align=center><IMG border=0 
src="Pull down and Popup Menus_files/menu_2.gif"></DIV>
<P></P>
<P>When an item is typed in the Caption text box, it also appears in the menu 
control list box. Selecting an item in the list box allows its properties to be 
edited (in a similar way to editing properties of controls in the properties 
window).</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <P>An item that appears on the left margin on the list box is the menu 
  title.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Menu items are indented using the right arrow control. Move back to a 
  previous level using the left arrow control.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The up and down arrows are used to move among the menu entries.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The insert button opens up space for an extra menu entry above the 
  currently selected item in the list. The delete button removes the selected 
  item.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>If submenus are required (further drop down menus off menu items) these are 
  created by indenting twice (using the right arrow control). At run time, the 
  presence of a submenu is indicated by this symbol to the right of the menu 
  item it hangs off). Four levels of submenus are supported.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The ampersand ‘&amp;’ is used to Precede the character that is to be 
  underlined on the menu as the keyboard access character.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>If the Caption of a menu entry is set to a hyphen ‘-’, this causes a 
  separator bar to appear in the menu. Use this device to divide menus into 
  logical groups.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The name of a menu entry is the name that will be used in the program code 
  to refer to it.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The shortcut list allows any menu entry to be assigned a shortcut 
  (Ctrl+character) instead of, or as well, as an access key.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>If the property checked is set, this inserts a tick mark on the menu to 
  indicate which of a set of options is currently in force.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>If the property <TT>Enabled</TT> is set to false, that item is gray (faded) 
  on the menu at run time and does not respond to events.</P>
  <P>At run time, <TT>mnuClose.Enabled = False</TT> would gray out the item 
  <TT>Close</TT> on the first menu example.</P>
  <LI>
  <P>The property <TT>Visible</TT> is used to determine whether the menu item is 
  visible or invisible at run time. If a menu item is invisible, the items below 
  it move up to fill in the space. If a menu title is invisible, that menu does 
  not appear on the menu and all the menu titles to the right of it are moved 
  one place left.</P>
  <P>At run time, <B><TT>mnuSaveAs.Visible = False</TT></B> would remove the 
  item <TT>Save As...</TT> on the first menu example. </P></LI></UL><BR>

<H2><I>Pop-up Menus</I></H2>
<P>A pop-up menu is one that is displayed on top of a form and is not attached 
to the menu bar.</P>
<P><B>PopupMenu Method Example:</B></P>
<P>The code below displays a pop-up menu at the cursor location when the user 
clicks the right mouse button over a form. To try this example, create a form 
with a menu named “mnuFile” (“mnuFile” must have at least one submenu). Copy the 
code into the Declarations section of the form then run the application.</P><PRE>  <B><FONT color=#23238e>Private Sub</FONT> Form_MouseDown <FONT color=#23238e>(</FONT>Button <FONT color=#23238e>As Integer</FONT>, Shift <FONT color=#23238e>As Integer</FONT>, X <FONT color=#23238e>As Single</FONT>, Y <FONT color=#23238e>As Single)</FONT>
    <FONT color=#23238e>If</FONT> Button = 2 <FONT color=#23238e>Then PopupMenu</FONT> mnuFile

  <FONT color=#23238e>End Sub</FONT></B>
</PRE>
<P>In the above example, the pop-up menu appears at the X, Y position of the 
cursor, when the right mouse button is pressed (Button = 2). Use VB Help to 
explore the flags that can be set to specify the behaviour of a pop-up menu.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> All controls are displayed relative to the co-ordinates of the 
parent object, so setting X and Y both to 0 displays a pop-up menu at the top 
left corner of the form.</P>
